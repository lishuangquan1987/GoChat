# Task 23 问题优化 - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the three optimization features implemented for the GoChat client application.

## 1. Window Title Shows Username After Login

### Implementation
- Added `window_manager` dependency to `pubspec.yaml`
- Updated `main.dart` to initialize window manager for desktop platforms
- Modified `UserProvider` to update window title when user logs in, logs out, or updates profile
- Window title format: `GoChat - {username}` when logged in, `GoChat` when not logged in

### Key Changes
- `lib/main.dart`: Added window manager initialization
- `lib/providers/user_provider.dart`: Added `_updateWindowTitle()` method
- Window title updates automatically on login, logout, and profile changes

### Platform Support
- Windows ✓
- macOS ✓  
- Linux ✓
- Mobile platforms: N/A (no window title concept)

## 2. Chat List Shows Conversation Records After Chatting

### Implementation
- Enhanced `ChatProvider` with persistent storage capabilities
- Added conversation and message persistence to local storage
- Updated friend list to properly create conversations when starting chats
- Conversations are automatically saved and restored on app restart

### Key Changes
- `lib/services/storage_service.dart`: Added conversation and message persistence methods
- `lib/providers/chat_provider.dart`: Added `loadConversationsFromStorage()` and related methods
- `lib/pages/friend_list_page.dart`: Updated to use `getOrCreatePrivateConversation()`
- `lib/pages/home_page.dart`: Load conversations from storage on app start

### Features
- Conversations persist between app sessions
- Messages are cached locally for offline viewing
- Automatic conversation creation when chatting with friends
- Conversations appear in chat list immediately after first message

## 3. Multi-Instance Support with User-Specific Data Storage

### Implementation
- Enhanced storage service to support user-specific data isolation
- Added user switcher interface for managing multiple accounts
- Implemented user-specific data directories in application documents folder
- Added account switching functionality in profile page

### Key Changes
- `lib/services/storage_service.dart`: Complete rewrite to support multi-user data isolation
- `lib/pages/user_switcher_page.dart`: New page for selecting between multiple accounts
- `lib/main.dart`: Updated splash screen to show user switcher when multiple users exist
- `lib/providers/user_provider.dart`: Added methods for managing multiple users
- `lib/pages/profile_page.dart`: Added "Switch Account" option

### Features
- Each user's data is stored separately in `{AppDocuments}/GoChat/{userId}/`
- Support for multiple simultaneous app instances with different users
- User switcher interface shows all previously logged-in accounts
- Secure token storage per user using Flutter Secure Storage
- Automatic user selection when only one account exists

### Data Storage Structure
```
{Application Documents}/GoChat/
├── {userId1}/
│   ├── user.json
│   ├── conversations.json
│   └── messages/
│       ├── private_{friendId}.json
│       └── group_{groupId}.json
├── {userId2}/
│   └── ...
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
- `window_manager: ^0.3.7` - For window management on desktop platforms
- `path_provider: ^2.1.2` - For accessing application documents directory

### Storage Strategy
- **Secure Storage**: User tokens (per-user isolation)
- **Shared Preferences**: User preferences and settings (per-user keys)
- **File System**: Conversation data and message history (user-specific directories)

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of conversation data
- Message caching with size limits (200 messages per conversation)
- Automatic cleanup of inactive conversation caches
- Debounced UI updates to prevent excessive rebuilds

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Window Title**: Test login/logout/profile updates on desktop platforms
2. **Conversation Persistence**: 
   - Chat with friends and verify conversations appear in chat list
   - Restart app and verify conversations are restored
   - Send messages and verify they persist
3. **Multi-Instance Support**:
   - Login with multiple accounts
   - Verify user switcher appears
   - Test data isolation between users
   - Test simultaneous app instances with different users

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cloud Sync**: Sync conversation data across devices
2. **Export/Import**: Allow users to backup and restore their data
3. **Advanced User Management**: User profile pictures, status messages
4. **Enhanced Security**: Biometric authentication for user switching
